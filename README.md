# Beating-XGB (Work in progress)
Comparison of various classifiers on multiple datasets

I aim to convince myself of how XGB stacks against most of other classifiers.
Multiple metrics  on multiple datsets will reveal how much each classifier benefits from approaches such as feature engineering, advanced encoding techniques, 
PCA, and hyperparam. optimization. Will XGB classifier be beaten in some of the cases?
